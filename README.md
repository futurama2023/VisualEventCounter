# VisualEventCounter
Get insight into any chain of events.

Here's a brief overview of the features and functionality of VisualEventCounter (VEC):

Event Tracking

The app allows users to create and customize different events they want to track manually with individual. For example, it could be the number of product sales, or the number of times one's taken their medication, or the number of times a yellow car has passed by your window. Any metric. With the press of a button.

Each event will have its own dedicated counter that users can increment or decrement based on manual input. The counters act as the primary tracking mechanism within the app.


Visual Graphs

The app generates visually appealing graphs and charts based on the tracked event data. These graphs can be viewed by users to gain insights into the performance of their events over time.

Various graph types are available, such as line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and area charts, allowing users to visualize their data in different ways.


Timeframes and Filters

Users can select specific timeframes to view the graphed data, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or custom date ranges. 

This allows them to analyze the performance of their events at different scales.

VEC also offers filtering options, enabling users to focus on specific segments or subsets of their data. For example, they can filter data by geographic location, target audience, or campaign type.
